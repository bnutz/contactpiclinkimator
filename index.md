## Contact Pic Linkimator

Contact Pic Linkimator is a simple and light app to keep the contact pics in your address book updated with the latest profile pics from your friends' social media accounts. 

No logins required! 

Just enter their usernames or IDs from their Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or Google+ accounts and Contact Pic Linkimator will handle the rest.

Social media usernames are saved with your contact entries in the "Contact Notes" field in your address book. So if you sync your address book across multiple devices, the usernames will be automatically backed up and transferred to those devices via Android's own Contact Sync. No need to worry about backing up or losing settings (Google Contacts users will also be able to see and manage their friends' usernames on [contacts.google.com](https://contacts.google.com)).


**Note:** All profile pics will be downloaded from the public profile pages of your friends' social media pages. So if the availability of the images will be dependent on the privacy settings of your friends.


Designed to require as few permissions as possible:
- Read/Write to Contacts (for updating the contact pics)
- Network Access (to download the latest profile pics)

That's it!
