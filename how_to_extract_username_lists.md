### Step 1
Open this page from a desktop browser.

### Step 2
Choose an option for extracting URL links from a webpage:

#### Option 2a: (Chrome & Firefox)
 - Either install a browser extension that can do this for you:
   - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/extract%20links?_category=extensions
   - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/search/?q=copy+links

#### Option 2b: (Chrome only)
- Or, if you don't want to install any external browser extensions, use the [bookmarklet](#file-username_links_extract-bookmarklet) at the bottom of this page:
  - To use, create a new bookmark in Chrome, name it whatever you want, and then copy the raw text from [`username_links_extract.bookmarklet`](#file-username_links_extract-bookmarklet) into the address field.
  - Once saved, the bookmarklet is now ready for use.
  - *[`username_links_extract.js`](#file-username_links_extract-js) contains the same code in an easier-to-read format and with a breakdown of exactly what the script is doing*

### Step 3
Once your browser is prepared, navigate to the Friend List page of which ever social media network you want to pull from:

 - https://www.instagram.com/ [your_username] /following/ 
   - *(May need to click the "following" link to have the friend list appear)*
 - https://twitter.com/following
 - https://www.facebook.com/ [your_username] /friends
 - https://plus.google.com/circles

### Step 4
Scroll the page down to load the full list of friend names into the browser window.

### Step 5
Once loaded, use your browser extension or bookmarklet to pull out all URLs from the page into a nice plain-text list.

Save this to a text file on your computer and remove any non-username URLs from the list.

### Step 6
Send this list over to your device using whatever method you like, for example:

 - Dropbox
 - Pushbullet
 - WhatsApp
 - AirDroid
 - Email
 - *etc...*

### Step 7
Open the Contact Pic Linkimator app on your device and go to the "Friend Lists" section, open the import box and paste in the URL list and click OK. The app will pull out all the usernames for you to Linkimate.
