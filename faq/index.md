#### How to keep my Contact Pics updated with my friends' latest profile images?

- Go to the contact you want to keep in sync and make sure a target username is selected (see above)
- Enable the `Scheduled Sync` toggle button
- Go to the `Sync Schedule` page (via the navigation drawer on the left)
- Enable the `Enable Scheduled Sync` toggle button
- Configure your sync options

**Note:** The sync tasks is handled by Android's own JobScheduler service, which automatically determines the best time to start a sync operation (depending on battery level, network avaiabilty, available resources, etc.). Contact Pic Linkimator is only able to submit the sync tasks as a scheduled job, it does not control the start times itself.
